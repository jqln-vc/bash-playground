# Shell Scripting: Discover How to Automate Command Line Tasks
*by Jason Cannon @ Udemy*



## Section 2: Shell Scripting, Succintly
### Exercise 1
Write a shell script that prints "Shell Scripting is Fun!" to the screen.  
* Hint 1: Remember to make the shell script executable with the chmod command.
* Hint 2: Remember to start your script with a shebang!  

### Exercise 2
Modify the shell script from exercise 1 to include a variable. The variable will hold the contents
of the message "Shell Scripting is Fun!".

### Exercise 3
Store the output of the command "hostname" in a variable. Display "This script is running on "XYZ". Where "XYZ" is the output of the "hostname" command.
* Hint: It's a best practice to use the ${VARIABLE} syntax if there is text or characters that directly preceed or follow the variable.

### Exercise 4
Write a shell script to check to see if the file "/etc/shadow" exists. If it does exist, display "Shadow passwords are enabled." Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can, display "You have permissions to edit /etc/shadow." If you cannot, display "You do NOT have permissions to edit /etc/shadow."

### Exercise 5

Write a shell script that displays "man", "bear", "pig", "dog", "cat", and "sheep" to the screen with each appearing on a separate line. Try to do this in as few lines as possible.
* Hint: Loops can be used to perform repetitive tasks.

### Exercise 6
Write a shell script that prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option.

### Exercise 7
Modify the previous script so that it accepts the file or directory name as an argument instead of prompting the user to enter it.

### Exercise 8
Modify the previous script to accept an unlimited number of files and directories as arguments.
* Hint: You'll want to use a special variable.

## Section 3: Exit Statuses and Return Codes
### Exercise 1
Write a shell script that displays "This script will exit with a 0 exit status." Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.

### Exercise 2
Write a shell script that accepts a file or directory name as an argument. Have the script report if it is a regular file, a directory, or other type of file. If it is a regular file, exit with a 0 exit status. If it is a directory, exit with a 1 exit status. If it is some other type of file, exit with a 2 exit status.

### Exercise 3
Write a script that executes the command `cat /etc/shadow`. If the command returns a 0 exit status report "Command succeeded" and exit with a 0 exit status. If the command returns a nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command failed" and exit with a 1 exit status.

## Section 4: Functions
### Exercise 1
Write a shell script that consists of a function that display the number of files in the present working directory. Name this function `file_count` and call it in your script. If you use a variable in your function, remember to make it a local variable.
* Hint: The **wc** utility is used to count the number of lines, words, and bytes.

### Exercise 2
Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the `file_count` function accept a directory as an argument. Next have the function display the name of the directory followed by a colon. Finally, display the number of files to the screen on the next line. Call the function three times. First, on the `/etc` directory, next on the `/var` directory and finally on the `/usr/bin` directory.  

```bash
    # Example output:
    /etc:
        85
```
